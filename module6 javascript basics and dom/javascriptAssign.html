    <h4>What is JavaScript?</h4>
    <div>
        <p>JavaScript is client side scripting lang</p>
        <p>We can plugged in JavaScript to our HTML page With script Tag</p>
        <p>js is prefered in foot</p>
        <p>we can perform</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Handle events</li>
            <li>Slider</li>
            <li>Time based events</li>
            <li>Dynamic CSS</li>
            <li>User input DOM manupulation</li>
        </ul>
    </div>


    <h4> What is the use of is NaN function?</h4>
    <div>
        <p>
            The isNaN function takes a single argument and performs the following checks:
        <ul>
            <li> If the argument is already of the type "number" and its value is NaN, the function returns true.</li>
            <li>If the argument is not of the type "number," it is first converted to a numeric value. If the resulting
                value is NaN, the function returns true.</li>
            <li>If the argument is of the type "number" and its value is a valid number, the function returns false.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <li> console.log(isNaN(123)); // false</li>
        <li> console.log(isNaN('456')); // false</li>
        <li> console.log(isNaN('abc')); // true</li>
        <li> console.log(isNaN(NaN)); // true</li>
        <li> console.log(isNaN(true)); // false</li>

        </p>
    </div>

    <h4>What is negative Infinity?</h4>
    <div>
        <p>In JavaScript, negative infinity is a special value that represents a number that is infinitely small or the
            smallest possible value. It is denoted by the constant Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY. </p>

        <ul>

            <!-- using this example in script tag -->
            <li>var x = Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY;
            <li> console.log(x); // Output: -Infinity</li>
            <li> console.log(x + 10); // Output: -Infinity</li>
            <li> console.log(x * 5); // Output: -Infinity</li>
            <li> console.log(x / 2); // Output: -Infinity</li>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>


    <h4> Which company developed JavaScript?</h4>
    <div>
        <p>JavaScript was developed by Netscape Communications Corporation, a now-defunct computer services company. It
            was initially created by Brendan Eich in 1995 while he was working at Netscape. The language was originally
            named "Mocha" but was later renamed to "LiveScript" and finally to "JavaScript" for marketing purposes, as
            Java was gaining popularity at that time.

            Netscape released JavaScript as part of their Navigator web browser in September 1995. It quickly gained
            popularity as a scripting language for web development due to its ability to provide interactivity and
            dynamic content on web pages. JavaScript's success led to its adoption by other web browsers, and it
            eventually became a widely supported language across different platforms.</p>
    </div>

    <h4> What are undeclared and undefined variables?</h4>
    <div>
        <p>Undeclared variables: These are variables that have not been explicitly declared or defined in the code. When
            you attempt to use an undeclared variable, it typically results in a runtime error or an exception,
            depending on the programming language. The error message usually indicates that the variable is not defined
            or that it is an "undefined" identifier</p>
        <p>Undefined variables: These are variables that have been declared but have not been assigned a value or have
            been assigned a special value that represents an absence of meaningful content. When you attempt to access
            the value of an undefined variable, it will typically return a value called "undefined." This typically
            occurs when a variable is declared but not initialized with a value</p>
        <p>
            <li>// Undeclared variable</li>
            <li> console.log(undeclaredVariable); // Throws a ReferenceError: undeclaredVariable is not defined</li>

            <li>// Undefined variable</li>
            <li>var undefinedVariable;</li>
            <li>console.log(undefinedVariable); // Output: undefined</li>

        </p>
    </div>

    <h4>Write the code for adding new elements dynamically?</h4>
    <div></div>

    <h4> What is the difference between ViewState and SessionState?</h4>
    <div>
        Session state is saved on the server, ViewState is saved in the page. Session state is usually cleared after a
        period of inactivity from the user (no request happened containing the session id in the request cookies). The
        view state is posted on subsequent post back in a hidden field.
    </div>

    <h4>What is === operator?</h4>
    <div>
        The strict equality ( === ) operator checks whether its two operands are equal, returning a Boolean result.
        Unlike the equality operator, the strict equality operator always considers operands of different types to be
        different.
        <p>for E.g :- 123 === "123" =====> returns false as both operand types are different</p>
        <p>for E.g :- 123 === 123 =====> returns true</p>
        <p>for E.g :- "string" === "string" =====> returns true</p>
    </div>

    <h4> How can the style/class of an element be changed?</h4>
    <div>
        <p>
        <h5>changing with style</h5>

        <p>// Changing inline styles</p>
        <p>var element = document.getElementById("myElement");</p>
        </p>element.style.color = "red";</p>
        <p>element.style.fontSize = "20px";</p>

        <h5>changing with class</h5>
        <p>
        <p>// Adding and removing CSS classes</p>
        <p>var element = document.getElementById("myElement");</p>
        <p> element.classList.add("newClass");</p>
        <p>element.classList.remove("oldClass");</p>
        </p>

        </p>
    </div>

    <h4>How to read and write a file using JavaScript?</h4>
    <div>
        <p></p>
    </div>

    <h4>What are all the looping structure in JavaScript?</h4>
    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>For loop</li>
            <li>while loop</li>
            <li>do-while loop</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>ES6 loops</b>
                <li>for-in loop</li>
                <li>for-of loop</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h4>How can you convert the string of any base to an integer in JavaScript?</h4>
    <div>
        In JavaScript, you can convert a string representing a number in any base to an integer using the parseInt()
        function. The parseInt() function takes two arguments: the string to be parsed and the base of the number
        system.
    </div>

    <h4> What is the function of the delete operator?</h4>
    <div>
        <p>
            The delete operator in JavaScript is used to remove a property from an object or to delete an element from
            an array. Its function depends on the context in which it is used:
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Deleting Object Properties</li>
            <li>Deleting Array Elements</li>

        </ul>
        </p>
        </p>
    </div>

    <h4>What are all the types of Pop up boxes available in JavaScript?</h4>
    <div>
        <p>colnsole.log() => developer oprtion for debug</p>
        <p>alert() => popup success or signgle aknowlegment</p>
        <p>confirm() => get confirmation for aprove or rejection</p>
        <p>prompt() => get inputs from the user</p>
        <script>
            // alert("called")
            // alert("Loggedin success")
            // confirm("are you sure??")
            // prompt("Enter addition of 5+5")


        </script>
    </div>


    <h4>What is the use of Void (0)?</h4>
    <div>When a hyperlink is clicked, the browser typically follows the URL specified in the href attribute. However, by
        setting the href value to javascript:void(0), the browser executes a JavaScript function that does nothing
        (returns undefined), effectively preventing the default navigation behavior.</div>

    <h4>How can a page be forced to load another page in JavaScript?</h4>
    <div>To force a page to load another page in JavaScript, you can use the window.location object or the
        window.location.href property. </div>
    <script>
        // window.location.href = "https://www.gogle.com";

    </script>

    <h4> What are the disadvantages of using innerHTML in JavaScript?</h4>
    <div>
        <h5><b><i>Security risk</i></b></h5>
        <p>Using innerHTML to dynamically modify HTML content can introduce security risks if the content being inserted
            comes from untrusted sources</p>
        <h5><b><i> Perfomance impact</i></b></h5>
        <p>Manipulating the innerHTML of an element can be computationally expensive, especially when dealing with large
            or complex HTML structures. Repeatedly modifying the innerHTML of an element within a loop or frequently
            updating it can lead to a performance impact, as the browser needs to parse and re-render the entire HTML
            content each time. In such cases, alternative approaches like manipulating the DOM directly or using more
            efficient methods like createElement and appendChild may offer better performance.</p>
        <h5><b><i>Limited control over specific element</i></b></h5>
        <p>Using innerHTML is a convenient way to modify a chunk of HTML as a whole, but it provides limited control
            over individual elements within that HTML. It becomes more challenging to selectively modify or interact
            with specific elements or parts of the HTML structure when using innerHTML. In such cases, manipulating the
            DOM directly or using specialized methods like querySelector and createElement offer more flexibility and
            control.</p>
